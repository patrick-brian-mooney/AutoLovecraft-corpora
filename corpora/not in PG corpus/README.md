# About These Texts

This folder (`not in PG corpus`) contains stories that are intended to be fed to my text generator to produce automated blog entries for my blog <a rel="me muse" href="">The Worst of Bad Lovecraft</a>, but do not originate from <a rel="muse" href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0600031h.html">the Project Gutenberg collection</a> from which most of the other input stories are derived.

They are organized into folders indicating their source.
