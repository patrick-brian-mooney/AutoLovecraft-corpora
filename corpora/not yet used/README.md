# About this folder

This folder contains texts that have been pre-edited, but have not yet been used to produce blog entries for <a rel="me muse" href="http://autolovecraft.tumblr.com/">The Worst of Bad Lovecraft</a>. It also contains zero-length files with "(not yet edited)" in their names; these are mere references to remind me what still needs to be edited from the Project Gutenberg corpus.

Feedback on these texts, like all texts in this project, is always welcome. Please be sure that you have read the editorial principles in <a rel="me author" href="https://github.com/patrick-brian-mooney/AutoLovecraft-python/blob/master/corpora/README.md">the master README file for these texts</a> before suggesting changes.
